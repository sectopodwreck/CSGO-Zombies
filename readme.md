# CSGO Zombies
## By: BP

I've talked about my experience with programming this project on [V1.0's documentation](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1914665835)

**BUT**, the current build you see before you is MUCH better than the old script.

## Installation
1. Go into CS:GO's root directory.
2. Go into `csgo`
3. Copy and paste all of this file's contents into there.

You will now be able to play it by:
1. Booting up the game.
2. Opening the console.
3. `map bp_zombies_newreadmethod`

## Changes from V1.0
### Player Side
* Weapon skins for CT teams will now show up.
* Random weapon cases are more refined.
* Zombies drop powerups (Nuke, Max Ammo, Revive, Heal all)
* Infinite amount of players can play. (Compared to the max 10 cap)
* "Hurt Chambers" are not needed.
* Wallbuys allow you to refill your ammo for 1/2 price.
### Level Developer Side
* Wallbuys and doors do not require you to set functions or go into the script. Everything can be done via `targetname`'s.

I'll add more to this readme later...
